## Features

### Flexible and easy to use

- Designed to work with any OAuth service, it supports 2.0+, OIDC
- Built-in support for [many popular sign-in services](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/tree/main/packages/core/src/providers)
- Email/Passwordless authentication
- Passkeys/WebAuthn support
- Bring Your Database - or none! - stateless authentication with any backend (Active Directory, LDAP, etc.)
- Runtime-agnostic, runs anywhere! (Docker, Node.js, Serverless, etc.)

### Own your data

Auth.js can be used with or without a database.

- An open-source solution that allows you to keep control of your data
- Built-in support for [MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, SQLite, GraphQL, etc.](https://adapters.authjs.dev)
- Works great with databases from popular hosting providers

### Secure by default

- Promotes the use of passwordless sign-in mechanisms
- Designed to be secure by default and encourage best practices for safeguarding user data
- Uses Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Tokens on POST routes (sign in, sign out)
- Default cookie policy aims for the most restrictive policy appropriate for each cookie
- When JSON Web Tokens are used, they are encrypted by default (JWE) with A256CBC-HS512
- Features tab/window syncing and session polling to support short-lived sessions
- Attempts to implement the latest guidance published by [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org)

Advanced configuration allows you to define your routines to handle controlling what accounts are allowed to sign in, for encoding and decoding JSON Web Tokens and to set custom cookie security policies and session properties, so you can control who can sign in and how often sessions have to be re-validated.

### TypeScript

Auth.js libraries are written with type safety in mind. [Check out the docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/typescript) for more information.
